## My process
 - i took my time to study what semantic element and layout i need to achieve it.
  - i started with the skeleton as always then 
  -then touched the css aspect of it
  -finally i made it responsive to look good on all screensize
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- divs
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

ohh i learnt a lot. first all is not as it seems with layout. 
- i learnt about the ::marker pseudo code and how to implement it
- i learnt the proper usse of sementic layout an why they are important 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  ul li::marker {
    color: apple green;
  }
}
``
### Useful resources

- [MDN docs](https://www.MDN.com) - This helped me understand how to use the ::marker atrribute for lists. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
